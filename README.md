Description:

  I tried to implement post operation and get operation in shortest possible code. With the use of jpdb-common.js library funcions.
  All the code in main.js is commented so any one can understand the inner working of my simplistic project.

    It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
    It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
    It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
